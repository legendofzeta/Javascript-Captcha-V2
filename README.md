This captcha is a JavaScript implementation that requires a user to input the result of a simple arithmetic problem (addition or subtraction of two random numbers) and hold down a submit button for 10 seconds in order to view the protected content.

When the submit button is clicked, a timer starts counting down from 10 seconds and the progress is displayed in a bar. The bar is filled as the timer counts down, and if the user holds the button for at least 10 seconds and inputs the correct answer to the arithmetic problem, the protected content is displayed.

If the user releases the submit button before 10 seconds have passed or inputs an incorrect answer, the progress bar is reset and the user must try again.
